# Computational-Engineering
Here we've used a lot of numerical methods to do simulations for the real world situatuins, like Applied Thermodynamics, Elasticity and Plasticity(Deformation of the objects), Electromagnetism theory, Piezoelectricity, Elastic dielectrics, the combination between electromegnetism and mechanics, polarization and rheology. All the simulations here couldn't be done with python alone, though it's the main programming tool for that, but we've used another scientific tools for the designing multiple geometric shapes and solving partial differential equations and other mathematical stuff. That's here the first example, the others could be found in another reposoteries
